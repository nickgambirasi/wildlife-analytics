### **Project Status**

This project was completed around 12/01/2022, and the report is now available for viewing from the repository. The report contains information about how the IoT sensors were constructed in a cloud-based simulation environment, how they were deployed in a simulated version of the African Savannah, and also how the data obtained from these sensors were used to assess the health of the animals, as well as their behaviors. 

### **Project Motivation**

The African Savannah is home to several different species of animals that are at risk of going extinct and need to be continuously monitored. In an area as vast as the desert, consistently surveying the animals manually is not a feasible solution from a time-to-complete standpoint, and is also poses risks to the scientists who are required to be in the desert to complete the surveys.

The use of IoT devices to monitor important information regarding the health and safety of the animals is a much more time-sensitive and a safer way to track the health of these animals. Data can be transmitted to centralized computing areas, where analytics on animal health can be completed and anamolic events can be detected instantly using machine learning. The only time that scientists would need to travel into the desert is to resolve technical problems associated with the IoT sensors.
